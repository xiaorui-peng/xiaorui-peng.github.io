Hello, it's great to have you on my website! My name is Xiaorui Peng (彭 潇锐). I was born in Chongqing, China, and pursued my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering at the Beijing Institute of Technology. I then went to Duke University, where I earned a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering.

Currently, I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at the University of Michigan. My research is centered on photoacoustic imaging, which combines light and sound to create detailed images of tissues, aiding in non-invasive medical diagnostics and treatments. I'm passionate about using this innovative technology to advance healthcare and improve patient outcomes.

If you want to reach out to me, please feel free to contact me at xiaoruip [at] umich [dot] edu, or connect me on my Linkedin.
