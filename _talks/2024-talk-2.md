A longitudinal study on both 3D and 2D photoacoustic and Doppler ultrasound imaging of human hand rheumatoid arthritis progression has been performed using an automatic imaging system based on GEHC VividTM E95 with L8-18i-D probe and OPOTEK tunable laser system. Bi-weekly imaging has been performed starting from baseline (before patients start medication). Both photoacoustic and Doppler ultrasound can confirm the disease development, however, photoacoustic has higher correlation coefficients (with a median of 78.9%, p = 0.039) with patientsâ€™ PGA score.
