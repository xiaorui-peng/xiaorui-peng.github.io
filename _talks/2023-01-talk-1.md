A longitudinal study on both 3D and 2D photoacoustic and Doppler ultrasound images of rat leg rheumatoid arthritis development has been performed using an automatic imaging system based on a GE HealthCare VividTM E95 unit with a L8-18i-D probe, an OPOTEK tunable laser system, and a Universal Robots UR3 robotic arm. Daily imaging of ankle bones was performed starting from day 0 when the lyophilized Mycobacterium butyricum was injected to induce the disease. Although both photoacoustic and Doppler ultrasound can confirm the disease development, photoacoustic imaging is more sensitive to microvasculature and enables earlier detection of inflammation than Doppler ultrasound.
